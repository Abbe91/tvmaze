## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Overview

This web application is a TV show search engine built with TypeScript and ReactJS. It provides a responsive user interface that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices. The application has been tested and verified to function correctly on the latest versions of popular browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

Features
1. Views
The web application consists of three main views:

Home Page: This page includes a search form for TV shows and displays search results.

Search Result: After performing a search, this view presents a list of TV shows based on the user's query.

Details View: Clicking on a TV show in the search results navigates the user to a detailed information page for that specific show.

2. Technology Stack
The project is written in TypeScript, leveraging the ReactJS framework. The decision to omit CSS libraries and frameworks ensures a custom styling approach for a unique and lightweight user interface.

3. Responsive Design
The web application is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations for a consistent user experience across different devices.

Documentation
The repository includes comprehensive documentation on how to run the application. Please refer to the README.md file for detailed instructions on setting up and launching the application.

Nice to Have (Implemented)
The application is written in TypeScript.

ReactJS is the chosen framework for building the web application.

No external CSS libraries or frameworks were used, ensuring a custom styling approach.

Nice to Have (Pending)
Due to time constraints, some of the desired features have not been fully implemented. Future enhancements may include:

Feedback to users regarding errors or slow API connections, enhancing the user experience.

Routing improvements to enable users to share direct links to detailed information about a specific TV show.

Implementation of tests for better code quality and reliability.

Additional design enhancements, including animations and a more refined user interface.

Usage
To run the application, follow the steps outlined in the README.md file.
